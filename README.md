  ## Description
  
  This is an application where you can get, save, and delete notes using the Express Server in Node js. This application was deployed with Heroku.

  ## General Information
  
  ### Installation
  
  To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  
  ```npm i```

  The neccessary dependencies--Express and uiudv4--should install with this command, assuming you downloaded the package.json file correctly. 

  ### Usage 

  This repo requires both the Express and uiudv4 modules to run correctly. Express is module that allows you to create HTTP routes in your code to fetch and alter information on the server. uuidv4 creates v4 UUIDs, which helps your code identify specific notes in your code to act upon them.
